Mobile App Dev - App Brainstorming
===
## New App Ideas - List
1. Roommate Finder App (local to UCSD, social)
   - attempted to create this with a different project group as a web app but never finished
   - UCSD has niche housing types (i.e. different colleges, apartment style/suite style) so it would be really beneficial to create an intuitive app that allows people to find potential roommates/groups on campus! the UCSD roommate networking system is disappointly lackluster and nearly nonexistent!! 
   - could potentially expand to off campus housing as well, but i think that can be staged in later features
   - would work potentially as an iOS app as opposed to web app!
2. social spotify.... (social/entertainment)
    - i don't really have an exact plan for this but i really like how the spotify web browser let's you stalk your friends' listening sessions ... the app doesn't have that but i think it should!!!
    - this might "deter" from the fact that spotify should be a music streaming platform first and foremost but maybe there can be a "feed" for your friends to post their songs, playlists, podcasts, etc whatever and write statuses and you can comment on it :p
3. personality test!! (entertainment)
    - idk about this one but making a personality test seems fun...it's not necessarily a mobile app specific item

## Top 2 New App Ideas

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Roommate Finder App
   - **Description**: Serves as an accessible medium for UCSD students looking for roommates living on-campus since the UCSD on-campus housing system can make it hard for people to room with friends from different colleges
   - **Category:** Social Networking
   - **Mobile:** Mobile let's you bring the app on the go and get notifications whenever you get new matches! The one downfall of restricting this to a web-only app would be for this very reason.
   - **Story:** People will be able to match with people who have similar living habits and live in the same college!
   - **Market:** This is uniquely for UCSD students who plan on living on campus, although this can definitely be expanded to the entire UCSD population (beyond on-campus housing) with future updates!
   - **Habit:** People will be constantly meeting and interacting with new potential roommates through this app!
   - **Scope:** The barebones first V1 would include user profile creation and being able to see the collection of other users who have high-decent compatibility! I hope to be able to implement features for liking profiles and seeing the profiles that matched with you during this V1 as well. V2 would be implementing chat functionality, updating user profiles/deleting profiles, blocking/ignoring certain profiles. V3 would include implementing "group" profiles where multiple profiles are presented under the same group profile, safety/reporting options... in general this app idea has a lot of potential to grow and there are many great inspirations out there (i.e. hinge, tinder, etc.)
